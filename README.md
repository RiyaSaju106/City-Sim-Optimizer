# City Sim Optimizer

City Sim Optimizer is an **AI-powered urban simulation and decision-support platform** designed to help city planners and administrators model infrastructure stress and visualize optimized responses in real time.

Urban cities often face challenges like traffic congestion, waste overload, and water shortages. City Sim Optimizer provides an **interactive dashboard** to simulate such disruptions and instantly generate actionable insights.

## Problem Statement

- Urban cities face frequent infrastructure stress (traffic, waste, water shortages)
- Delayed response due to lack of real-time monitoring
- No interactive platform for citizens and planners to simulate and resolve crises

## Solution

**City Sim Optimizer** is an AI-powered, interactive dashboard that allows planners to:
- Simulate city-wide disruptions
- Visualize health metrics instantly
- Receive AI-driven optimization suggestions

## Features

-  **Interactive Dashboard** for live city health simulation
-  **Real-time Sliders** to adjust traffic, waste, and water stress
-  **City Health Score** calculation based on:
  - Traffic Congestion Index
  - Waste Stress Levels
  - Water Availability
-  **AI Suggestions** tailored to each city scenario
-  **Shortest Route Finder** for emergency navigation
-  **Save & Compare Scenarios**
-  **Citizen Reporting Integration**
-  **Health Meter with Emoji Indicators** for quick visualization


## How It Works

1. User adjusts city stress parameters (traffic, waste, water)
2. System computes a **City Health Score**
3. AI analyzes the scenario
4. Optimized suggestions are generated
5. Results are visualized via meters, emojis, and recommendations


## Tech Stack

- **Backend (AI Engine):** Python, Flask
- **Simulation Logic:** AI-based scoring & rule systems
- **Server:** Node.js, Express
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Development Tools:** VS Code, Git
